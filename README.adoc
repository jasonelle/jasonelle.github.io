_Jasonelle_ (a.k.a. _Jasonette_) is quite a different way to make an app. Make _iOS_ and _Android_ apps with _JSON_ (and some _JavaScript_ sparkles), loaded over _HTTP_ or local file.

## Vision

*Mobile Apps as easy as writing a blog post*


> We are only alive for a short while and learning any new technology is a sacrifice of time spent with those you love, creating art or walking in the woods. üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëßüé®üå≤ Every framework you learn is a lost opportunity to build something that could really matter to the world. Please choose responsibly. ‚è≥

## What is Jasonelle?
_Jasonelle/Jasonette_ is a small framework for making _Mobile Apps_ (Android, iOS) using _JSON_ and _JavaScript_.

Advantages:

- It comes with a predefined set of tools to allow native access to android and ios sdks
- You can use your already made web app or can create something 100% native with json

When to use:

- You have already made a web app and need to convert it to native
- You want to experiment and create small tools 
- You are a single developer / small business that needs a native app but don't have funds to hire a mobile developer team

When not to use:

- You need something using the latest frameworks and languages
- You have a team of native android and ios developers who can build something with other frameworks like react native
- You have a specific use case that would need native development. In this case this would require special consideration if _Jasonette_ fits your use case.

## Examples

There are lots of examples available here

## Additional Official Docs
