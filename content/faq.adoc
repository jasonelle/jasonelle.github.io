## ‚ùì FAQ

### How it was born?

https://jasonelle.com[Jasonelle] started as a fork of _Jasonette_. But after some years,
so many things have changed in the mobile landscape, _SwiftUI_ was born,
many frameworks were created, trying to solve the same niche that _Jasonette_ originally has since 2016.

Roughly _80%_ of the use cases for https://jasonelle.com[Jasonelle] were people trying to
wrap their Web application, often made with "no-code" tools like https://bubble.io/[Bubble]. Those apps only needed some sparks of native functionality (like Push Notifications).

It was needed fresh air and a new engine. So in 2022 it was made
from scratch, implementing the bare functionalities needed for
the mayority's use case. It's no longer a fork of _Jasonette_, but
it maintains the same spirit.

### Will be an Android version?

Android is a huge market, but we don't currently have bandwidth to create and maintain something for it. We will wait the iOS version to be
polished enough before thinking about porting it to Android.

### Jasonette's future?

We think _Jasonette_ reached it's purpose. Was a pionering technology, even before _SwiftUI_. After it, many other tools implemented similar ideas and workflows.

You can still use it today. But we won't be it's maintainers anymore.
If you wish to keep the flame of _Jasonette_, feel free to fork it
and reach to us for any question at our https://t.me/jasonelle[telegram].

We are thankful for _Ethan_ and all the other wonderful people
that participated in the _Jasonette_ project over the years.

### Main Jasonelle use case?

The best use case it's a web application that is running on your server.
And you want to wrap it around a native layer, for access to features
only available in native mobile phones.

Using Jasonelle's JS bridge you can easily make native functions and
pass data between Web and Native layers.

Another good use case is a simple local html file that can be loaded.

### Which are the alternatives?

Currently there are many good choices, depending on your needs,
some of them would be more suitable than Jasonelle.
